Around 2016 or so me and godsoft on hangouts
discussed a major problem with mod menus
and that was if you tap the main button twice it
would show 2 menus & #1 wouldn't disappear.
so i told godsoft some key-pointers & he came up with this idea.
*/

/*
func showMenuBtn()
made by Godsoft029 & ArceusMatt
Allows you to show popup after it's been dismissed.
*/
function showMenuBtn(){
//your layout here
//your button here (btn)
//your popup variable here (gui)

/*
inside btn onclick we'd dismiss gui then
call showMenuBtn() whenever we wanted the button to come back.
this solution would fix the menu being stuck on the screen.
